OBJECTIVE
The goal of this project was to analyze the SFR (SpaceFund
Realty) ratings of aerospace
companies and their missions to help investors make better
decisions.
WHAT IS SFR ?
The SpaceFund Reality (SFR) rating is designed to provide
investors, customers, regulators, media, and the industry itself
with a quick guide and assessment of players old and new in
the various sub-sectors of the space industry.

DATA OVERVIEW AND PREPROCESSING
Assess model performance using metrics like RÂ², MSE,
and cross-validation to ensure generalization to unseen
data.
Select algorithms, train models using training data,
and fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize
performance.
Clean, transform, and encode data, handle missing
values, and scale features for better model
performance.
Understand data distribution, relationships, and identify
outliers or missing values using visualizations and
statistics.

Data Size: 2196
Data Shape: (183,12 )

In conclusion after using PCA and employing TOP N features we determined the following on the features:

Feature Importance Analysis
Feature importance analysis revealed the following key features:
Funding ($M): 30.8%
Launch Cost ($M): 20.3%
Payload (kg): 18.9%
Altitude_Suborbital: 11.4%
These features were consistently found to be the most influential in determining SFR ratings.
