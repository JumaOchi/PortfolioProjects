COVID-19 Data Analysis with SQL

This project involves analyzing COVID-19 vaccination and death data using SQL. The goal is to gain insights into various aspects of the pandemic, such as vaccination trends, death rates, and country-specific analysis, by writing and running complex SQL queries. Project Overview

Using the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset, this project demonstrates how SQL can be used to analyze large datasets, focusing on key metrics like new vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations, deaths, and population data across various countries and continents. Objectives:

Data Import and Setup: Load the dataset into SQL Server and structure the data to support querying.
Data Exploration: Perform exploratory queries to understand trends in COVID-19 vaccination and death statistics.
Advanced Queries: Use window functions, joins, aggregate functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract deeper insights.
Reporting: Generate insights on cumulative vaccinations, population analysis, and death statistics.

Datasets

COVID-19 Vaccinations Data: Contains vaccination records such as new vaccinations, cumulative vaccinations, and location details.
COVID-19 Deaths Data: Contains information about COVID-19 deaths, population, and date per location.
